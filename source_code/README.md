# Requirements
install package in the requirements.txt file(use command: pip install -r requirements.txt).
create a folder called input.
if the video maker is not working in main.py try running vid.py.
after finishing video you can press ctrl+c to try to insert the audio into the video.
if it failed, you can use a video editor to insert the audio (after finishing it will generate a audio.wav)

(colored video will often take more frames and more space to generate, e.g. Bad apple took me about 10 to 20 min to make and took about 3 GB, rickroll took me about 1 hours and took 10 GB of space, they both have about 6000 frames).

Also make sure you have ffmpeg installed or else it won't work.
