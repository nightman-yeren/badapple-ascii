Bad Apple But in ASCII!

# About
I've been using this script to turn the legendary bad apple to ascii form, I came up with this idea when I encountered a video to ascii tutorial,

then I took some inspiration and help from the internet, and the project is formed!

You could use the source code on anything you like, just remember to have a good RAM(not like me I only have a 16 GB ram for a super good desktop).
